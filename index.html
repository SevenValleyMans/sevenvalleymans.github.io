        <p>What is CSS?
            • Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the standard for defining the 
           presentation of documents written in HTML.
            • Presentation, refers to the way the document is displayed or delivered 
           to the user, whether on a computer screen, a cell phone display, 
           printed on paper, or read aloud by a screen reader. 
           • CSS is a separate language with its own syntax

        <ul>
            <li><a href="main.html">item 1</a></li>
            <li>item 2</li>
            <li>item 3</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            In the example the width and height values
            are applied to the content area only.
            • The resulting width of the visible element
            box ends up being 550 pixels (the content
            plus 40px padding and 10px of border).
            • Knowing the resulting size of your elements
            is critical to getting layouts to behave
            predictably.
